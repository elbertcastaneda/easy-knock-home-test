# Questions

1. What do you like about being a programmer or software engineer? What aspects do you not like?
    - I love to be a `Software Engineer` because in my opinion is a very exigent career. Thanks to that you are growing all-time in all aspects of your life (Personal and Professional). Because once that you adquire a new skill you can start to implementing it also in you personal life, so that is beatiful (A kind of super power).
    - I also love to be a `Software Engineer` because we can create `something` from scratch and this is not easy to found in other kind of jobs.
    - I think that I hate to myself when I spend more time than established to work because I am working with something that is challeging me, sometimes I have trouble to sleep when I am on this state in my mind.
    - Sometimes when I have a mistake I am very cruel with myself because as a `Software Engineer` you know you can't justify your errors if you want to keep on the improvements way.
1. What aspects of the working environment (e.g. company culture, team structure,
etc...) allow you to do your best work?
    - Company culture
    - Continuous Growth
    - Work with professionals (To learn from them)
    - Sharing Knowledge enviroment
    - Obiously compensations are very important to me (Salary, Benefits) 
1. What is your favorite programming language/stack and why?
    - `Node.js`
    - `React.js`
    - `Express`/`Nest.js`
    - `Next.js`
    - Database is depending of the scope and requirements (Usually I would like to use: `MongoDB`, `Postgres`, or `MariaDB`)
    - For Caching/Settings I prefer use `Redis`
    - Why this stack?, as we noticed my favorite stack is around `JS/TS` (Yes, I love JS/TS) but let try to give more convincent reasons:
        - Universal domain language.
        - Avoid the fatigue to be switching your brain between languages.
        - In fact with React we are achieving use JS/TS instead of any views template language like Angular/Vue/Svelte, or Handlebars, Pug, or EJS in the server side.
        - The maximum ubral of base code re-using (Even between BE/FE).
        - The tools that I mentioned has a great and big open source community (Including a great documentation).
        - JS/TS are easy to learn.
        - We have a lot of posibilities, when we need to scalate and application developed over this stack (Next.js and SSR is a great example of this).
        - Find `Software Engineers` with the most of this skills is very easy.
        - CI/CD easier to configure than others, because all is based on `Node.js`.
